# AirBnB Clone

## Descriptions

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

## Console

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of AirBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application.

### Using the Console

The AirBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively.
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
$
```

Alternatively, to use the AirBnB console in interactive mode, run the
file `console.py` by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
```

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
```

To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal
(`ctrl-D`).

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```
